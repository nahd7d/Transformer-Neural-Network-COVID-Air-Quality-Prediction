# Transformer-Neural-Network-COVID-Air-Quality-Prediction
This project examines the relationship between air pollutants—CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, SO2—and COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admissions, ICU bed occupancy, and COVID-related deaths. Leveraging spatial-temporal data analysis techniques, this study explores correlations between these environmental variables and COVID-19 metrics over time. This comprehensive analysis reveals significant associations between air quality indicators and various COVID-19 outcomes across multiple states and counties. To facilitate predictive modeling, the attention transformer neural network was employed. Through predictive modeling efforts, the study forecasts Air Quality Index of the most harmful pollutant, hospital admissions, COVID hospital admissions, ICU bed occupancy, and COVID-19 deaths with high accuracy and granularity. By integrating spatial and temporal information, the attention transformer model provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between environmental factors and disease outcomes across the United States, facilitating evidence based decision-making in public health policy and resource allocation.
